I have absolute an unequivocal evidence that Musicly is listening to my every move. I've known they were tracking my patterns for some time but I didn't complain. Their automatically generated playlists are far too good for me to believe that they are random.

Each iteration brings at least a few songs I find worth adding to my playlist. It's called "Liked Songs". Boring I know, but its just a name. It's the easiest way for me to curate my list. If I'm listening to a song that the great hand provided and I like it, I just have to press the two ellipse over lapping to save it to my playlist. Otherwise I'd have to press several pixel groups in order to conjure the ability to add a song to the playlist. Of course I will choose the shorter route.
