    "Hello, world.

I am the guy who ruined the game for everyone.

I am writing this letter to tell everyone that I am sorry. I did not realize that it was all just a game to everyone. I'm sure you are all pissed about having to find a new way to spend your time together but imagine how I feel. I went my entire life not knowing it was all a joke and then suddenly the entire world is against me. A dizzying experience to say the least.

I also feel incredibly stupid. So thank you for that. Why didn't anyone tell me? Sure, I'm still young and, hopefully, have a long time to live, but I wonder what the world would be like if everyone were let in on it from the beginning.

Maybe we wouldn't have any more wars. Those are pointless to anyone who gets the joke.

What if there weren't any more hungry people either? I don't see anything holding us back from that if everyone were told from the start.

I could go on but that's not what I'm here to do.

I sincerely want to apologize but before I do I have to say a couple more things.

Out of all the games there were to play, why did you have to play this one? Sure, there was no harm to the individual on the surface, one could argue it is actually good for them, but what about the masses?

It's kind of gross if you think about it. If anyone thought to look under the covers they'd see that it's definitely perpetuating different curable diseases that are out there.

The way the game is played is a violation of ones privacy too if you ask me. There's nothing wrong with doing what you do in the game if you want to but why do we have to expose the fact that some people do it to the world and make fun of them for it? Most people do it still after they figure it out but they get to keep it to themselves.

One last thing before I get to my apology letter. What is with the name? You could have at least chosen the correct anatomical parts. Octopuses don't even have tentacles, they have arms. If you want to make a joke at the construction human language then call it the \"Church of the Ten Armed Octopus\", they don't have tentacles.".to_string()
