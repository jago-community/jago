I have never read any William Shakespeare. I hope to someday, just haven't got around to it. However, I do have to say I feel like I've heard plenty to understand his perspective. Six of his words is all it took. The rest just enhance the image. He put it perfectly, but I want to offer an alternate ending.

If to be or not to be, porque no bailamos?
