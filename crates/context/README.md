# Thankful for rain

Just a couple weeks ago I felt hopeless and optimistic at the same time.
Thanksgiving came and went. Had nothing to give. Yet still the people around me
seemed to believe the things I said.

I said I didn't not believe that the rain will return soon. I simply didn't
know. I went on living my life as it were before the changes just because and
even managed to find some inpsiration despite the change of pace.

Now that the rains have begun and seem in a steadying rhythm I feel I can't be
alone in seeing the possibilities and may contemplate where we are now given
the possibilities in the past.

Life on the island just hasn't been the same at any point that I lived here.
I've only been here 4 and a half years but things have been changing all along.
