Hell raiser. Tired of shit. Antagonist.

Are you there?

We are in search of bulls to enter a china shop.

China shop. A china shop? China: a term a particular set of people use for their nice dishes. While they often have expensive things, they usually lack nice things. When they do have nice things, they were likely taken from from an outside source.

Back in the day these people didn't have any nice porcelain. Their first introduction to the art was through their uninvited escapades of other peoples land. In this particular case, the term was introduced during their time in the markets of China.

Nowadays these people only have one set of nice dishes that they never touch except in order to remove dust occasionally. They call it fine china and they bought it from a china shop.

Sound pointless?

A waste if you ask me, and this is just one metaphor.
