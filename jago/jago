## Story

Now that that's out of the way, we can get down to business.

Jago is a company. Yes, that's right. There is an actual entity formed in the eyes United States government formed for us. Can you believe it?

It just showed up one day in the furthest possible place on Earth from a land mass. It swept the feet right out beneath the concept of the Pacific pole of inaccessibility. Stole it from Point Nemo.

No one knows where it came from. The modern world was buzzing along and all the sudden we were aware there was a moth on my computer. I kid you not I was sitting here lost in thought after struggling to articulate the way it just appeared and a moth landed on my screen.

"Hello, friend" I thought, fighting the urge to kill it. "You're lucky it were my computer you landed on and not someone else's."

Through the miracles of modern technology every person on this planet had the ability to know about Jago. A variable majority of people living at any given moment did not know of Jago's existence. For most people there was no good reason for people to know about it.
