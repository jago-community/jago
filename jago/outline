## Introduction

After wandering aimlessly down the path of least resistence for a few years
after graduating with my degree in computer science, I found myself
contemplating my position in society. I'd look out the floor to ceiling windows
next to my desk over an alley way inhabited by severely mentally ill
individuals that our current society has decided to either demonize or ignore
altogether. This enhanced my depression brought on by the coming of age in this
post war world.

I was fired from my last salaried position but given a healthy severence which
inspired more wandering. I fulfilled my rite of becoming a few cliches. I
wanted to start a company, worked as a barista, tried to learn to paint and
decided I wanted to write books. I even worked in retail for a while where I worked
with the sharpest group of people I'd crossed paths with in my wandering.

All the paths I looked down seemed enticing to say the least but I couldn't
shake that constant state of anxiety that is contemplating my later years of
life in our status quo. This is what got me considering going back to school.
Due to my nationality this thought served as both a possible door to a more
fulfilled life and another heaping sense of anxiety of the loan debt I will
acrue.

To avoid this reality I kept the cliche of starting a company toward the front
of my facade but all I really want is a consistent stream of income to meet my
basic needs so that I can contribute to society in ways that actually seem
useful rather than how someone else has managed to monetize.

In my attempt to bring this to reality most of my free time the past few years
intellectually wandering around the free and open source software world,
looking at how things were built. I thought about making my own version of a
lot of things and then trying to make an income stream of it but I never saw a
path that seemed like something I thought would cure this existential dread. 

I landed on the desire of making my own text editor. It was a project that
could intrigue enough interest from others to want to contribute as well as
provide a means of creating an avenue down many different aspects of the
software world. Despite finding a project I felt inspired to tackle, there were
a couple problems:

1. Could I actually do it?

I knew I could make at least a crude implementation of one but not one that
could be more useful for me than the ones already out there.

2. Someone beat me to it.

Through my explorations I stumbled upon a project made by someone during their
time at school. The only problem is that the project lost it's steam once the
author graduated.

The combination of those two points weren't enough for me to deter the desire
to make a text editor but the name of the school itself did the trick:

> Alec Thompson's Anarcho-Communist School for the Unemployables.

The school was started by someone who was lucky enough to be at the begining
of a company that sold for a large amount of money. The school only has one course
and its whatever you decide to do that results in you feeling satisfied. 

Which brings us to here.

Before I get started, I don't want to make this podcast. I'd rather write
books. There are several problems with this:

- My degree is in computer science
- The audience my ambition would want to hear what I have to say wouldn't read it.
- I don't know if I'd make a living doing it.
- Etc.

But I have to create something for my thesis at Alec Thompson's
Anarcho-Communist School for the Unemployables. I know that the people I want
to hear what I have to say won't listen to this either but the school's super
computer sure will.
