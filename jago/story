The platform is best described as an unwilling capitalist company. We wish we could say we were anarcho communist but that would require people to believe in it. Problem is it's made up. Perhaps we'll call it anarcho capitalist for now.

There is no creator of the platform, it just sort of started happening at some point along the way and we just went with it.

An example of the pattern might be found after reading this: I bet you will figure out how to get to the next page.

We do not want your money, but we've gotta pay the rent. Life on the island isn't cheap anymore. That's what we like to call it. Ambiguity is funny occasionally.

The food is just too damn good. People come from each direction to see the sights and taste the things. Reasons included in the set that's keeping me here.

I hear and think a lot about the variety of seasonings used in the different kinds of foods we have here on the island. Ironic to me considering we don't have proper seasons from my perspective. I come from the middle of it all. It gets relatively hot there. Also relatively cold. To me, those are more or less the extreme conditions but I know in other places the numbers vary more.

Each part of the island has it's own unique climate. If you zoom in a little and switch the axis to your experience rather than numbers then the island might be roughly just as extreme as where I'm from because of the fluctuations on a daily basis.

Despite being completely surrounded by water our air is pretty dry. If you are walking down the street stepping from direct sunlight into a shadow could mean losing a source of a substantial amount of heat. No water means nothing to hold the heat in.
