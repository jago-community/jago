Depending on who you are, the title of this writing will mean a different thing to you. The valid answers will cover the full spectrum from nothing to a weird greeting to the first thing the aliens say when they begin a conversation with you.

For me it's certainly the latter. It's all I think about these days. It's not the life I imagined for myself but it keeps me occupied.

I spend most of my time writing out ideas to help with the ongoing negotiations with the aliens. I don't send most of them off. I don't feel like I have anything to say that isn't already being said. Plus, other people are much better at formulating arguments than me. I was always far too shy to join the debate team. Or sing in choir or really anything that required me to use my voice. If my choice was between think and speak, I would over think the decision.

Life changed for everyone rather suddenly when the aliens made their move. We went from competing with each other to trying to save our favorite hostages. A sort of cosmic game show that could have only been a reality inside our heads.
