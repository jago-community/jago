CankER just released some startling information.

```

According to them their automated answering service made first contact with aliens. That sentence started with a disclaimer because plenty would argue that ship sailed a long time ago.

```

"CankER's Jago Cafe, how may we help you?"

"Hello, is this Mars?"

"No, this is CankER's Jago Cafe, how may we help you?"

"Hello, is CankER's Jago Cafe on Mars?"

"No, CankER's Jago Cafe is on Earth."

```

This isn't very concerning in and of itself, but there was a reason they went public. They said the phone call happened enough to be automatically flagged as spam by the system, starting fairly soon after they launched it. They launched it nearly 40 years ago.

The system flags each call as spam after the first incoming message. There are no other variations that say this phrase. The system lets spam calls run despite the waste of power. They figure the cost of electricity to let the call run its course is negligible when compared to the value gained in seeing where it goes. They use the information to derive patterns and therefore potentially be able to catch ones they haven't seen before.

The first call that continued from there was only one more line and then it terminated on its own: "Oh shit, guess that means you're open."

At that point the.
