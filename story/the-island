Things are pretty expensive on the island. After having come to terms with the fact I started bargain shopping. Everybody knows it now too. Everyone bargain shops.

- Self checkouts are pervasive on the island.
- Felt called out because of self checkout announcing any time I made some savings.
- Every single item I purchased said savings. Everyone in the vicinity stared at me. Some people looked like they were judging while some seemed impressed that I saved so much money.
- Competition ensues to get the most performative output from the self checkouts.
- Small local stores start having their cashiers sing and stuff while they ring people up. A Droning Co's cachiers impersonate the self checkout systems.
