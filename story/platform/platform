I am making myself a table.

I apologize, that's a lie.

But I am working on one. Here it is:

Isn't it beautiful?

It was cheap. I bought it for 35 bucks. From someone on a different kind of platform.

I have no idea what the finished product will look like, but I'm excited to see how it turns out.
