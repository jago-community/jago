Step one: figure out how to appear to do nothing for a living.

It is more challenging than it appears. This is because nothing is just a concept. Basically the game is to figure out how to add the least amount of hair to the metaphorical hairball that we inhabit together, but make it fun.

The challenging part is convincing yourself that you are effectively nothing. You more than anybody know that you are not nothing. Weird that that's the goal, right?

Step two is to convince people to give you money for it.

Step `,?`, don't forget the point.
