This is some advice from a home schooler for learning computer programming.

Step one is to understand the context. I can only speak to my experience growing up but as a rule of thumb I can say that your guardian doesn't think anyone else's opinion matters with respect to you. This can mean many things but in mine I feel fortunate in saying that it was because my parents loved me too much to send me off into the school system. They were worried for my life, and we all know why.

My family was one of the many to join the recent trend of families to home school their kids following the normalization of mass shootings throughout the public. Others have been home schooling for as long as families have been a thing. It's where it all started, naturally.

For most of familial existence, that was the only option. Just a distribution problem. Sure, some sort of system definitely existed for distributed education from the dawn of human groups. The first lesson being, we are good, and other is to be questioned accordingly. From then on each branch formed more or less in cohesion with each other, if not from interaction but from the shared setting of the human body.

As long as people have been able to move from one place or another they have brought with them one set of experience to a place that harbors others.
