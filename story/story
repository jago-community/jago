Me and my roommate reincarnated Charlie, my childhood cat.

He is a neural engineer at an engineering firm working on a surgical robot. He just joined the team that is working on the part of the implant that takes in visual data from the doctor's occipital lobe, the part of the brain that takes in visual data.

Occipital. A word that means "of, on, or in the back of the head" [according to etymologyonline](https://www.etymonline.com/word/occipital), the university I'm attending. But apparently, there is no correlation between occipital's roots and [those of oculus,](https://www.etymonline.com/word/oculus) a word that means "to see". I don't buy it. Good thing it's just a website, not a real university and I only pay a nominal fee.
