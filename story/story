Life on the island has been easier since the population decreased.

After wars were over and the fungi were released, the race to mars accelerated at a surprising rate. Not long after pretty much everyone with money was gone. The landscape was a bit different too. The island that those billionaires made to avoid international regulations on flow of their money. Their goal was to get off the planet as soon as possible so they just made themselves a loophole.

Their variation on the loophole is that of an island of trash. The world's biggest multi-medium Ponzi scheme as far as I know. I can't speak for Mars either but I don't think we'll ever see one on that scale again.

It all started with that email. If you could afford a computer then you remember it. I remember where I was when the notification popped up. I was snorkeling near a rocky shoreline not far from an edge of the island. I was thinking about climbing the rocks above the water but I wanted to check out the landing area. There were a fair amount of rocks under the water but I wasn't too worried about it. In most cases there was ample room to bring my body to quick arrest after contact with the water.

I was primarily worried about any plant growth under the water. It's common to find varying types of fungi anywhere near any of the island's borders. For a variety of reasons a number of types of fungus seem to be emitted from the island. The type of fungus I'm looking out for in this scenario is the rock fungus. It grows on rocks and somewhat confusingly grows to look exactly like the rock it happens to be growing on. A defining characteristic with all rock fungi is they always look exactly like the host rock, no matter the type of rock. Encoded somehow in the DNA structure is to grow the color and texture of its surroundings.

While this makes my job harder its not why I'm worried. If I fall into shallow water and a rock fungi happens to get some spores into my bloodstream, I become the host. It will begin to grow around my leg, appearing fleshy yet solid in form. If I were in the water and didn't have a mask on I'd either drown or the fungus would have compromised enough of my vital organs and I'd likely fade off into ephemera as the fungus effectively disconnects my neurons.

Anyway, I'm not trying to be a downer about it. That's really the only fungi of that variety I have to worry about as a result of my lifestyle. If I see the fungi then I just move on to the next spot. Either way, I'm just swimming around.

I'm sure you've got your own opinions but as far as I know my opinion is shared by many. What did they expect when they decided to build an island out of trash? I'm sure the guy the Ponzi scheme is named after was rolling in his grave. These guys wanted to get away from the scary fungi so quickly that they funded space colonization by collecting every bodies trash. They got it for basically free too.

The scheme determined was to give everyone off the island a nominal amount in exchange for their trash. The alternatives for people off the island were as such:

- figure out how to reuse their trash in some way
- the government would collect it for free

While most people didn't understand why the government would do it for free, everybody accepted the offer from the billionaires on the island. Sure the money wasn't much, but it wasn't nothing.

The billionaires then used the trash as material for the underside of their island. A variety of technologies were funded to create as close to a utopia as I think the human race will ever see out of a floating pile of trash. These billionaires funded the whole thing by the people buying the products that produced the trash in the first place. If they had stayed it could have been the first perpetual motion machine but it turned out to look more like cancer.

The fungi came out of the wars but the island perpetuated and possibly accelerated it. Not much cleaning was put into the trash if it were used on the underside. The chemical waste that comes along with the products created ideal scenarios for mutations on the already invasive fungi. Some just a natural evolution but some in experimentation by those on the island. The people on the island also had to deal with the invasive fungi in their on way. They maintained a massive park system with a not yet destroyed native plant population in many places around the world. In addition to the parks they maintained swaths of land to farm their food.

Now that the people are gone its just the animals. There are still people here but for the most part we feel more closely related to the animals than the people who left. There are still some remnants of the people around but for the most part we think of it as just one big park. Things are much better now but we still have to deal with the fungi.

I set off to give you a description of why I was checking the water underneath the rocks and then recounted a history we all are aware of. The point of all that was to relate the moment I got the notification.

As I was swimming around by the cliff my marine tracker transmitted the notification to my goggles. An electromagnetic current ran over my glasses instructing the tiny fungal spores to grow in a specific pattern across my goggles. The growth appears almost instantly. I don't know how someone came up with it originally but it's pretty helpful to not have to have all the metals involved in computer parts.

This fungus is effectively infinite as long as the main net stays up. The dna sequence is available freely on the main net. Anyone can use their dna sequencers, made widely available by technological advancements from the island, could print this or any other computer sequenced dna pattern stored in the CankER datasets.

The distribution of the fungus is no longer temporal. It doesn't require being shipped around the planet anymore. A kind of fungus might go extinct in some regions in the middle of the night but it just gets printed again the next time someone needs it's function.

The pattern that grew before my eyes told me I had an important message from the heads of the island. I had just arrived and hadn't gotten all my paperwork done yet. I thought maybe that's what it was about. When I determined there wasn't any rock fungus in the landing zone I got out and began my walk home.

On the way I pulled out my tablet to read the message. To my surprise it wasn't a demand for me to sign some papers, it was actually an apology. I know all of us got it but I'll put it here anyway. Maybe somebody from several hundred years into the future will read this and not have all our context. The email read:

> Excuse me everybody,
>
> I have something to say. First, I will say thank you for being our loyal consumers. Without you we would not be able to bring the things we do to the people.
>
> It is with great regret to come to you with an apology. An apology for something that you are not yet aware of, but we feel obligated to tell you.
>
> As everyone is aware, we helped fund some pioneering technology for bringing lab grown meat to the masses. It was clear to everyone that waste from the livestock industry was causing an acceleration in the spread of the fungus.
>
> The science community reached out to us for help. They needed money to operate and we wanted to extend our time.
>
> We gave billions to the lab grown meat industry and they helped replace the need for livestock farms. Once the land was allowed to restore to its natural botanical state it was more resistant to the fungal spread. Our investments paid off for everybody.
>
> After the success of the investment we decided to bring it to the masses. You all responded with great numbers. From our calculations no one on the planet was eating meat from an animal that was killed anymore.
>
> This is all great news for humanity on all accounts. Here, unfortunately is where our apology begins.
>
> Here on the island we make bets with each other. One bet was that one of us couldn't trick each other into eating lab grown human.
>
> This was never meant to leak but someone won. They took a sample from their glutes and grew us some meat. The heads of the island have frequent dinners where one cooks for us and we talk about our future endeavors.
>
> On this specific individual's day to cook he presented us with a steak meal that turned out to be not what he advertised.
>
> After the meal was done he told us the joke and we found it to be equal parts surprising and hilarious. It was just meat and no one was killed. What harm could there be?
>
> The problem comes in when he accidentally synced his local dna sequences with main net. He has his sequences publicly available and our head of marketing noticed. He thought it was a variation on beef that had been in the works.
>
> The head of marketing made a deal with our distributors and sold nearly everyone meat grown with this sequence.
>
> If you have eaten any CankER beef in the last 5 years you have been eating our ass.
>
> We are sincerely sorry for any inconveniences and hope you understand.
>
> With respect,
>
> CankER Heads
