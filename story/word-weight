As a conceptologist, I spend a lot of time thinking about conceptual drift. In my opinion its the single most costly factor of the human condition. The dangerous ones move slow and steady. They go unnoticed longer and build up considerable inertia.

A kind pattern that is studied closely by conceptologists are what we call the "not" pattern. A simple pattern, probably the most common. This pattern often arises from a miscommunication.

A story I like to tell to illustrate this pattern starts long before I came to the island. What came of it, though, is one of the reasons why I never left. Some time between colonization and now the concept of astrology was introduced to the indigenous folk of the island. They loved the idea. They're interpretation at least. And it's true, I have to say, their way was better. This miscommunication shouldn't have turned out to be as big a deal as it was. I won't say it's the only place it could have happened. Theoretically any isolated one could have their own version of it.

When told that your astrology chart was based on where the moon was when you were born with respect to the constellations the indigenous people knew what they were talking about. They had both their own constellations and ceremonies based on celestial patterns and were happy to accommodate another. Why not, more fun and games, right? If it were what the islanders heard, fun and games is what life would be except when it were the month of their sign. During that time, they just go to work instead.
