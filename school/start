In the waning days of anarchist capitalism it became profitable to start your own school. Contrast this with the fact that in anarchist communism everything will be school. Since this is an attempt at showing an example of the common sense in it, you're reading this only if you want to. If you're reading this because someone made you, two things:

- You aren't reading it because of us.
- If you don't want to read it, just act like you are and they'll never know.

If they start to quiz you in multiple choice format, chances are you'll be able to figure out the right answer. There are patterns you can notice in the structures of the given answers. It's hard to avoid it since only the right answer isn't made up. If you have no idea, just pick a random answer. If you have to do this more than once, for statistics sake, pick the same option for each guess.
