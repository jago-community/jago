If you can aid us in gaining control of the domain name Random.org [please reach out to us.](mailto:contributors@jago.cafe)

This is a dot org name so it should be a trusted party but it is clear they are not.

Their home page claims they offer true randomness as a service. We get it, marketing and what not. But come on, it makes the rest of us look bad.

Sure, their form of randomness is based on atmospheric noise, but can you really call it random?

It may be as close as we'll ever get but let's call it what it is.

If you are from Random.org and you are reading this, here begins the negotiation.

Give us your domain and get another. If your service is so valuable just buy random.com. That's where all the real companies live.

If you feel the need to keep your dot org status, might we suggest inquiring about the status of arbitrary.org?
