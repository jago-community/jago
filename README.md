Dear Bill Gates,

I hereby demand you pay reparations. If you cannot find it in yourself to give away all of your wealth, then please use your position to give us our term back.

You helped create the culture that brought us the integrated development environment when all we wanted was a text editor. Why must you waste so much of our time? We asked for tools, not a bunch of robots. You say we are the people but you treat us like monkeys. Have you ever spoken to a monkey? Perhaps we wouldn't be where we are now if you only had.

Do you think it was the modern education system that made you think we needed an integrated development environment instead of an easier set of tools to use?

Bill, I have to ask. Did you use an integrated development environment when you wrote your first operating system?
