## Course

### Criteria

To pass this course you have to feel like you are done. 

### Projects

You will work on a set of projects you find useful. The usefullness may be found in the process of figuring it out or in the result itself.

If you can't think of anything or need some ideas for stepping stones to your big idea, just try to make your own version of something that already exists.

### Resources 

#### Software

[This non-profit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) has more than enough learning material to get you to the point where you know enough to figure out whatever it is you are trying to figure out with the internet. Use them as a resource to get moving on your course's projects. For example, [here's one where you make your own twitter.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-cross-platform-twitter-clone-with-vue-js/)

[Here is another non-profit](https://exercism.org/) that has more than enough learning material to get you started, but takes a different approach. It is more useful when you are trying to grasp programming languages themselves rather than what to do with them.

Below are other resources that we find interesting.

- [How computers reason about language.](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/nlp/)
- [(*not all free) Online courses provided by universities and industry.](https://www.coursera.org/)
