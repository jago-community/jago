Due to the nature of our crimes, we require some money. It's not our fault though, we have to pay rent.

You don't have to pay us anything for our services, but money does result in time.

> We do not currently accept payments through Venmo because there isn't currently a contributor who wants to use their real identity. Venmo is a little self righteous so we can't use our phone numbers for two separate accounts.

### Company

Right now, we're one. But not for long.

What a sentence. Just look at it. The way it's structured is nice.

First sentence split in two, the second just one. A balanced set of punctuation marks if you ask me.

This ruse won't last for long.

Back to the sentence.

Right now<#000>,<#> we<#fff>'<#>re one<a random color>.<a> But not for long<a random color>.<a>
