Hello strangers,

Jago is a community dedicated to working on technological projects with no monetary incentive.

Despite the exponential increase in possibilities that industry has brought about, there are remarkably few long standing projects dedicated to working for individual and community well-being rather than for corporate gain. In spite of the time requirements of general employment in the technology industry, the open source software world is an example of the communal heart and soul of human nature.

Jago's purpose is to leverage open source software and good will to ensure a sustainable future for projects that provide positive impact on communities without requiring a business model.

The best way to get involved is to contribute. While [monetary contributions](https://opencollective.com/jago-community) will help ensure more people and time can be devoted to community oriented projects, thoughtful contributions are what we appreciate the most. Write questions, suggestions or anything you'd like our community to see to us at [all@jago.community](mailto:all@jago.community). 

Additionally, we are currently working on a framework to make the creation of generally useful software much easier and accessible. If you want to see how you might contribute, take a look around this software repository. If you'd like to contribute but don't know how you would or you don't think you have the skills, don't worry: that's part of the goal. We maintain a [sort of psuedo-course](./course.md) that might help orient you're direction.

Thanks, ahora vamos a bailar.
