Hello strangers,

Jago is a community dedicated to working on technological projects with no monetary incentive.

Despite the exponential increase in possibilities that industry has brought about, there are remarkably few long standing projects dedicated to working for individual and community well-being rather than for corporate gain. In spite of the time requirements of general employment in the technology industry, the open source software world is an example of the communal heart and soul of human nature.

Jago's purpose is to leverage open source software and good will to ensure a sustainable future for projects that provide positive impact on communities without requiring a business model.

The best way to get involved is to contribute. While monetary contributions will help ensure more of us will be able to devote more time to community oriented projects, intellectual contributions are what we appreciate the most. We are currently working on a framework to make the creation of software applications much easier and accessible. If you want to see how you might contribute, take a look around this software repository. If you'd like to contribute but don't know how you would or you don't think you have the skills, don't worry: that's part of the goal. We maintain a [sort of psuedo-course](./course.md) that might help orient you're direction.

Thanks, ahora vamos a bailar.
