# Book for Concepts

> - Alec Thompson

This is a place for me to put some of my favorite concepts. It is a part of my attempt to get a degree in conceptology without attending school for it.

## Anarchy

The reason we are where we are as far as I can tell.

## Apocalypse

The chief opponent of conceptology as the field emerged. The overwhelming sense of approaching doom that comes with what the buddhist's call suffering. The monotheists saw the end of days and call it the enemy while the Mayans and others saw reflections of the cycle. A specific set of pagans in mind either too good at story telling or restricted to language that can be misleading.

After a particularly low swoop in the cosmic sin wave our ascent out of apocalypse seemed to be accelerated by the spread of conceptology. It proved to be an effective tool in the united effort to provide an equal and opposite action to cancel out the shared experience of impending doom we were all dealt. Just a few examples of marvelous even if outrageous feats of intelligent life are listed below:

- Vaccine creation perfected
- Climate change negated and proliferation of appreciation of plants.
- The vast majority of meat eaten is grown in a lab.
- A number of nuclear bombs planted in Yellowstone National Park. They are distributed to locations determined by a mathematical equation utilizing a set of numbers many of us are aware of: the fibonacci sequence. The equation produced a set of locations inside the range of the mouth of the volcano that mathematicians believe will provide the best chance of matching the force of the blast. The bombs are connected to sensors that will detect an eruption of the super volcano. The casing that they are in are designed to optimally direct the force of the nuclear explosion downward toward the direction of the volcano.

In the middle of it all is the densest item that all of humanity could muster up. This object is connected to each of the casings covering the nuclear bombs by cables able to withstand the heat of the explosion. The object will be launched at a velocity high enough to escape earth's velocity even while pulling all of that cable. By this time the dense casings of the bombs have become detached and enough heat from the explosion and then the atmospheric exit allowed enough of the cables casing to disintegrate enough that the inside material is able to expand into the lattice shape it's physical attributes were specifically configured to expand into. It's material just a few molecules thick and reflective enough that the photons of light emitted from the sun cause it to accelerate towards it's destination.

...

- Homeless rate of zero.
