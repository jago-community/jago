# Regular people

Today is the day my being a pseudo morning person comes to an end. I was never really a morning person though. A cursory viewing of the data from my phone's health app would say otherwise but I'd say that a chunk of the time was stolen from me and the rest I'd say I regularly threw away. I have a natural need to find some balance in my world.
