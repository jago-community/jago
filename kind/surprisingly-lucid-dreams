I dreamt that I died last night.

I got another shot yesterday. I decided to not take any medicine the whole day. As a result my dreams were surprisingly lucid.

In my dream I had reached the doorway to the end and god was there waiting for me. When he saw it was me he looked disappointed. He reached into his pouch and pulled out a script and read it to me. His voice a hissing whisper with the s sounds long and drawn out.

His monologue described to me all the ways I had not followed his plan. He pointed out all of my imperfections. He asked how could he possibly in good conscious let me in here since I had not followed the rules?

I knew the stakes were high. I had limited time. I had to arrange my words perfectly as to get the optimal number out. I can't get right to the point or he'll end it right away. If my message is too vague or wandering he will miss it entirely. In any case, it is all up to my ability to understand his perspective.

I started with an anecdote from the last time I got a shot. In this timeline my current reaction to receiving the shot wasn't registered or it was beside the point.
