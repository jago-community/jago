Hello everybody,

I made myself an audio file. That's right. This is my voice. On this here audio file.

Not for everybody though, that would be weird. If you are hearing a robot voice then you do not know me. I don't feel the need to share my voice freely so I decided to keep the data private, I hope you understand.

If you are reading this then you and I follow matching patterns and I think I like you, but you are not the one. There is no one to me and so I wrote these words for something. I can, however, offer you your own audio file and do it for free. All you need to do is continue reading. Just make sure you read the words aloud in your head and that's it! I call it the poor man's audio file. Speed readers don't fret, you don't need to do it.

If you are my computer, `!rand 0x0..9`.

If you are the one: ðŸ˜»

I find a lot of interesting things on the internet. I read parts of it then get distracted. Things often come with links and I can't not take a look. There are two kinds of people in this world. If you walk by an open garage in the rainforest, do you take a look?

There is just too much stuff to read on the internet. It's not that I want to read it all though, that would be unreasonable. Plus I just can't. I'm an anarchist so I don't have much time.

Here we are over 300 words into my audio file and I haven't even mentioned podcasts yet.

They are great. I've listened to a bunch. It's how I get a lot of my news.

I feel the ideal way to listen to this audio file is in your own voice. The easiest for that to be is to read aloud in your head. If you say the words yourself you may find less ambiguity.

But if you insist, I have an alternative. You can just give us access to your mic and read it again, but this time out load. Once you return here, we've heard all we need. We will do the rest.
