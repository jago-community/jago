The first summer into the pandemonium I was abducted by aliens. I was the subject of some experiments. The birds reached out to them and what we've been seeing is actually a result of their preparation to return.

The last time they were here was when the dinosaurs nearly drove life to extinction. The birds were left behind to look out for the pattern. We have not yet completed the pattern but we have walked the line for long enough for alarm.

I was abducted again three months later. They wanted to check in with me. They are trying to determine how to introduce themselves to the rest.

I was the subject of an experimental trial. Sort of a last ditch effort. What I experienced is hard for me to describe. I will never be able to accurately convey what it was that I saw but my doctors don't believe me though. They just say that I was in psychosis.

I didn't understand how they were going to get from what they did to me to creating a vaccine for everyone until I got the final product.
